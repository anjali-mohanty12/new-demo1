            <p><strong>Nature</strong> is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosphere_(planetary)" target="">ecosphere</a> or the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="">universe</a> as a whole. In this general
                sense nature refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law" target=""></a>laws,
                elements and phenomena of the
                physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole
                are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.
            </p>

            <p>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
                reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly
                became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as
                sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence
                or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one,
                got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[2]</p>

                Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can
                refer to the general realm of living beings, and in some cases to the processes associated with
                inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as
                the weather and geology of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target=""> Earth</a>. It is
                often taken to mean the "natural environment" or
                wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially
                altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured
                objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for
                example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that
                can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the
                artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a
                human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the
                unnatural or the supernatural.[2]
